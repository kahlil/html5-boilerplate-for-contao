## The HTML5 Boilerplate extension for Contao CMS #

This extension integrates the HTML5 Boilerplate into Contao CMS.
It makes HTML5 an optional doctype and optionally integrates [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net) and [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/).
It makes it easy to use all of the Boilerplate goodness with [Contao](http://contao.org).

After installing this via the Extension repository you can add jQuery and Fancybox at the bottom of your page layout. Fancybox will actually automatically work with Contao's lightbox image link markup.

**Update:** Updated to H5BP 2.0 and optimized it for Contao 2.10.0. This will not properly work with older versions of Contao.
